# Sound Flick Audio Visualizer and Spotify Playlist Generator

> ðŸŽ§ An audio visualizer made using web-audio API and javascript. You can upload a local Mp3 file and the visualizer will analyze the frequencies and make the bars bounce accordingly. I included 3 themes; warm, cool, and red/green, able to be selected below the visualizer. At the bottom of the page is a from you can fill out with artist names in a comma separated list and hitting create will generate a Spotify playlist made at random using the artist names provided.

# Getting Started

> To use this go to the url: https://sound-flick.firebaseapp.com/ and upload an Mp3 file off of your machine using the button that says Mp3, if the fie is supported music will automatically start playing and the visualizer will start. At below the visualizer is the form that you can fill out to create a Spotify playlist, just hit the create button at next to the form and your playlist will appear below (you may have to scroll down to see the playlist). The three radio checkboxes beneath the visualizer will change the color theme.
